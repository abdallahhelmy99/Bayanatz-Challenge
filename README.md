# Flutter Digital Receipts App

This Flutter app is designed to generate and manage digital receipts for services. It provides a reusable template that allows customization of fonts, styling, and logo size. The app supports multiple methods of accessing and retrieving receipts, including local storage on the device, retrieving them from a NoSQL database like Firebase, and receiving them via email as a confirmation of service.

## Features

- Customizable Textual Message: Easily customize the fonts and styling of the textual message displayed on the receipt.
- Adjustable Logo Size: Control the size of the logo to fit your branding requirements.
- Database Integration: Retrieve receipts from a NoSQL database like Firebase for seamless synchronization across multiple devices.
- Email Confirmation: Send receipts via email as a confirmation of service, providing a convenient way to share and archive receipts. (Not Implemented Yet)
